    "Welcome to this module on **DevOps and GitOps with Openshift Pipelines**, which is a pivotal component in the continuous integration and continuous delivery, or CI/CD, landscape.\n",
    "* Openshift pipelines is designed to create, manage, and optimize CI/CD workflows.\n",
    "* You'll start by learning a user-friendly interface, seamlessly integrated into the OpenShift developer environment.\n",
    "* With this interface, you can precisely define, orchestrate, and guide your application's DevOps workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you'll learn **how to construct tangible, real-world pipelines without the necessity of scripting a single line of code**. OpenShift pipelines ingeniously automates the generation of Tekton code, the underlying technology you should already be familiar with, while you work with tasks and pipelines using the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But what's education without application?** \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lab sessions, you'll unleash your newfound skills as you recreate a pipeline you've written from scratch using Tekton in the previous module. Only this time there's no coding involved.\n",
    "* As you delve into OpenShift pipelines, you're not just exploring CI/CD, you're venturing into the philosophy of GitOps.\n",
    "* This transformative approach leverages the power of version control, notably git, to manage and govern application deployments.\n",
    "* Then there's **Argo CD**, your gateway to operational excellence through GitOps.\n",
    "* Imagine a tool seamlessly synchronizing the applications running in your OpenShift cluster with your desired state from your git repositories.\n",
    "* With Argo CD, you're not just managing deployments, you're orchestrating a collection of infrastructure, configurations, and applications keeping them in constant sync.\n",
    "* This combination of skills equips you to navigate CI/CD, enhance deployment reliability, and streamline operations through DevOps and GitOps practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started on this journey together."

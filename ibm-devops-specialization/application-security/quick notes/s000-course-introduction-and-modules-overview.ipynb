    "This course is about application security for developers and DevOps professionals.\n",
    "* We're not going to discuss securing infrastructure, that's what security teams and the operations or SRE teams do.\n",
    "* This course is specifically focused on software engineers and what you need to know to truly embrace the Secure DevOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that the most significant security risks and concerns for developers over two decades ago are almost the same concerns today.\n",
    "* Many of the most recent concerns included in the **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 list** were the same as in 2007.\n",
    "* With ever-changing technology and almost incredible computer science and software engineering advancements, software engineers still fail to take the most basic security safety measures to safeguard their applications and close the door to threats and attacks. This is mostly due to poorly implemented security features that could have alerted the team to malicious attempts to break into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to **start practicing security by design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will help you **understand the common risks and vulnerabilities** that threaten your applications and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, \n",
    "* You'll learn about **DevSecOps**, an essential part of development and operations.\n",
    "* You'll learn about proactively **integrating security into your software development process**.\n",
    "* You'll also gain insights into the role of network security using modern TLS in OpenSSL.\n",
    "* You'll learn how mapping security into your development plan will increase your ability to recover from attacks and even secure your systems before an attack occurs.\n",
    "* You'll also learn about **vulnerability scanning and threat modeling** and gain a deeper understanding of threat monitoring.\n",
    "* You'll also **explore security testing and the different tools** and procedures you can use to mitigate the risks and impacts of security threats and vulnerabilities.\n",
    "* In the hands-on labs, you'll practice **analyzing code using static and dynamic analysis tools** and running tests to help you understand the process. \n",
    "* You'll dive into the **OWASP top 10 list which identifies current security vulnerabilities and concerns**.\n",
    "* You'll discover how hackers are exploiting common vulnerabilities in applications and systems.\n",
    "* Then in the labs, you'll get hands-on practice once again, **setting up tools like the vault secrets manager** via both a user interface and programmatically by reading and writing secrets to the vault.\n",
    "* You'll also learn tools that will help you **check and test the security of your code, dependencies, and development environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, \n",
    "* You'll be familiar with many of the key security terms and concepts commonly used by security teams.\n",
    "* You'll understand how security risks and vulnerabilities threaten your applications and systems.\n",
    "* You'll learn how to start coding defensively and makes sure that your applications are secure by design.\n",
    "* You'll be prepared to handle these security nightmares so that you can sleep soundly at night."
